# web-scraper

> **Warning**<br>
> This repository is currently under heavy development and currently this readme file documentation presents only the idea of the logic in the wish-list form.

This service is used to gather all prices information from web pages specified by the user. Ultimately it should have it's own UI with the ability to select the web pages that should be scraped and the concrete elements containing the interesting data.

 All the data should be stored in a JSON file which could be retrieved vie the REST endpoints. The ideal solution is that the user is able to define the output JSON structure
